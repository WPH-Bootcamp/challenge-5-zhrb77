# Challenge 1

## Simple Book Management Application

### **Description:**

Create a simple book management application using TypeScript. This application should allow users to:

1. Create a type for `book` where each book has a title, author, and publication year
2. Create `books` array to store books
3. Implement a function named `addBook` to add new books to the collection
4. Implement a function named `listBooks` to display all stored books
5. Implement a function named `searchBook` to find books by title (should be an optional parameter)
6. All functions must return void

### **Example Input:**

```typescript
// Adding some books
addBook('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 1925);
addBook('1984', 'George Orwell', 1949);

// Displaying all books
listBooks();

// Searching for a book by title
searchBook('1984');
```

### **Expected Output:**

```
> Book added: "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)
> Book added: "1984" by George Orwell (1949)
> All Books:
> - The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (1925)
> - 1984 by George Orwell (1949)
> Search Results for "1984":
> - 1984 by George Orwell (1949)
